        <p className={classes.para2}>WHAT IS HENNA?</p>
      </div>
      <p className={classes.para3}>
        Henna is a flowering plant! That is used to dye hair, skin, and clothes
        for thousands of years. The plant can be found in the subtropical region
        of Asia, Africa, and northern Australia. India, in particular, has a
        rich history with henna and cultivates the most high-quality henna crops
        in the world. The crops are then processed and used to make body art
        tattoo and to make henna hair dye.

        <p className={classes.para2}>WHAT IS HENNA POWDER?</p>
      </div>
      <p className={classes.para3}>
        The powder comes from the leaves of the henna plant which contain the
        red coloring pigment (lawsone). Lawsone is at its strongest when the
        leaves are ground into a powder. The lawsone pigment colors orange/red.

        <p className={classes.para2}>HOW DOES HENNA WORK?</p>
      </div>
      <p className={classes.para3}>
        The Henna deposits the Lawsone pigment (which is the coloring agent) on
        the outside of the hair cuticles. As the dye coats the hair strand and
        settles, it will bind to the keratin of the hair. The color darkens as
        the dye molecules absorb deeper into the hair binding to more protein.
        It also maintains the hairâ€™s natural highlights and undertones, creating
        a more natural-looking dye than your regular chemical hair dyes.
