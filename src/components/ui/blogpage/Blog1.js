      My last post got me thinking, we all have seen amazing bridal mehendi designs for our hands, but what about our feet? Every bride who 
      applies henna for her wedding ceremony does apply henna on her feet too, and doesn’t it then make sense to have some inspiration and ideas 
      bookmarked just for that?
      </p>
      <p>
      So, I ended up practically spending a good one full day scorching the internet for gorgeous real brides Bridal Foot Mehendi designs. Oh, and
      I found some seriously good ones, that you can totally show to your mehendi artist for inspiration.

      Peacocks are the latest trend in bridal mehendi designs. So many brides these days are doing variations of the peacock feathers on the hands
      and feet. I love this design. Its simple, yet stunning and the best part..you don’t have to sit through four five hours finishing your 
      mehendi.

      Everyone wants something a little hatke, a little unique in their wedding and this latest trend of doing minimalist mehendi design is a hot
      trend. Focus on the design and just leave the rest of the foot. It looks great, and you get to be traditional yet stylish at the same time.

      Why should you not dance and have a fabulous time instead of sitting frozen with the bridal mehendi artist. If you want to have fun at your
      event, then going for simple not too complicated is a good idea.

      There is nothing wrong in going all out traditional in your Bridal Foot Mehendi. If you have the patience to sit through, the results are 
      absolutely heavenly to look at. I personally love the sneak peek pictures with the lehenga border showing along with the mehendi design.

        You want to make a statement with your Bridal Foot Mehendi design, this is the way to go. The best part is, post the wedding, you can show 
        it off as a pretend gladiator sandals, and that’s quite cool.

        Do you see what I see? Just turn your head and look at it for an instant, and it will look like a nice pair of bohemian sandals.
        Awesome isn’t it?

        I love how the peacocks are designed as though they are looking at each other. This wedding was featured in my last post, and you just
         have to see it. There are so many steal worthy ideas from this gorgeous Sikh Wedding, I am not kidding you.

        How stunning does this look? The only bit which I don’t like particularly about mehendi designs, in general, is that when they are wet, 
        they look simply out of the world. But the actual problem comes when they are dried and washed off. Solid henna colors start chipping off 
        faster, so you better be sure if you really want a filled out design on your wedding day
